# Data Entry Web App (Chinese Interface)

This is a multi-step web-based form designed to collect user information and points data across three categories. The interface and all form labels are in **Simplified Chinese**, but the structure and usage are easy to follow for developers.

Overview:

The app guides the user through a series of forms:
1. **Password Verification** – Access is granted upon entering a valid password.
2. **Personal Information** – User inputs ID, wallet address, and contact info.
3. **Points Entry** – Users fill in certificate codes and associated point values for three types:
   - EEIGI Points
   - CNTV Points
   - 024 Points
4. **Summary and Submission** – A final review screen displays all entered data and totals.

Interface Language:

> **Note:** The entire interface, including all buttons, field labels, and messages, is in Simplified Chinese (`zh`).

To use or preview the application locally:

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
